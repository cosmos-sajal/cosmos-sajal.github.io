Orangehealth is a Y-Combinator S20 batch startup.

Our view on healthcare is that, like much else, it should reach our homes - conveniently and affordably. We believe being connected to your doctor matters. A personal connect and context in healthcare cannot be replaced. Effective medicine will be when online and offline worlds combine. Our efforts will be to create services and products that doctors can use with their patients in clinic or remotely at their homes to better assess and diagnose patients health and provide the right treatment.
